Gap Analysis
Gap analysis is a process that identifies how an organization's security systems deviate from those required or recommended by a framework. This will be performed when first adopting a framework or when meeting a new industry or legal compliance requirement. The analysis might be repeated every few years to meet compliance requirements or to validate any changes.

For each section of the framework, a gap analysis report will provide an overall score, a detailed list of missing or poorly configured controls associated with that section, and recommendations for remediation.

While some or all work involved in gap analysis could be performed by the internal security team, a gap analysis is likely to involve third-party consultants. Frameworks and compliance requirements from regulations and legislation can be complex enough to require a specialist. Advice and feedback from an external party can alert the internal security team to oversights and to new trends and changes in best practice.
