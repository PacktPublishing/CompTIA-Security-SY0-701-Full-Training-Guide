Hardening Concepts
Network equipment, software, and operating systems use default settings from the developer or manufacturer which attempt to balance ease of use with security. Unfortunately these default configurations are an attractive target for attackers as they usually include well-documented credentials, allow simple passwords and use insecure protocols which increase the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. Therefore, it's crucial to change these default settings to improve security.

Hardening refers to the methods used to improve a device's security by changing its default configuration. There are various ways for hardening switches, routers, server hardware and operating systems.



Switches & Routers

Change default credentials

Disable unnecessary services and interfaces

Use secure management protocols such as SSH and HTTPS instead of Telnet or HTTP

Implement Access Control Lists

Configure port security

Enforce strong password policies

Server Hardware and Operating Systems

Change default credentials

Disable unnecessary services

Apply security patches and updates

Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems

Secure configuration

Enable logging and monitoring

Use Antivirus and Antimalware solutions

Enforce physical security
